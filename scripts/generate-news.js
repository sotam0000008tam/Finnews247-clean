  paras.push(`From a market-structure perspective, derivatives activity, ETF flows and on-chain metrics (for crypto) continue to be pivotal. This dynamic creates both opportunities for active managers and headwinds for passive allocations.`)
  paras.push(`Earnings and data flow remain a primary focus. Companies with resilient revenue streams and prudent cost management have tended to outperform peers. Meanwhile, cyclical exposures remain sensitive to changes in interest-rate expectations.`)
  paras.push(`Looking ahead, the calendar of economic releases and corporate updates is dense; any unexpected data could prompt rapid re-pricing across asset classes. Risk management and scenario planning are critical for participants.`)
